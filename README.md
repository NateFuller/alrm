# What is alrm?
Alrm is a simple iOS alarm clock application. Our motivation is to create a pleasurable user experience for one of the least pleasurable points of the day: getting out of bed.
# Goals
We want to develop a pleausurable UX/UI on our own. That means we will create our own buttons, animations, layouts, etc.
We also wish to become more familiar with iOS development and alrm serves as a great chance to do so. Tutorials that we 
read along the way will help us learn best practices as we run into questions.
